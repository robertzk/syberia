\title{Run all tests in a syberia project.}
\usage{
test_project(project = syberia_project(), base = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{director or character. The director for the syberia project.
If a \code{character}, it will be passed to \code{syberia_project} first.}

\item{base}{character. Any subdirectory to test specifically. By default,
the empty string \code{''} which means "test everything".}
}
\value{
\code{TRUE} if all tests pass or will error otherwise. Note this
   function uses \code{pblapply} from the \code{pbapply} package to
   represent progress.
}
\description{
The tests that will be run are all those in the \code{test} subdirectory
of the root of the syberia project.
}
\details{
By default, no test setup or teardown occurs. That is, there is no code that
is executed before all tests run and after all tests run. However, there do
exist hooks to provide this behavior. This can also be used to perform
additional testing not covered by sourcing all files in the "test/" directory
of the syberia project.

To provide a setup or teardown hook, simply place a function or list of
functions in a local variable \code{setup} or \code{teardown}, respectively,
in \code{config/environments/test} relative to the root of the syberia project.

For example, creating a file \code{config/environments/test.R} with the code
code \code{setup <- function(env) cat("Running all tests.")} will print a message
before all the tests are run. The one parameter the function must take is an
environment which will contain a single key, `director`, pointing to the
`director` object coming from `syberia_project`.

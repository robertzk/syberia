\description{
By default, tests in a Syberia project will have access to the resource
they are testing as well the \code{testthatsomemore} package.
This function is responsible for bootstrapping this behavior in a
Syberia project. See the documentation for \code{test_project}
to understand how to create setup and teardown hooks (code that will be
run before all tests are executed).

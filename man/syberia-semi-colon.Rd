\title{Syberia is a development meta-framework for R.}
\description{
In its original formulation, in conjunction with
\href{http://github.com/syberia/modeling.sy}{the modeling engine},
Syberia serves as a machine learning classifier development framework.
}
\details{
The modeling engine provides an opinionated unified framework for
fast iteration on classifier development and deployment. It is
founded on convention over configuration and aims to solve the
problems of classifier-specific data preparation and
classifier-specific modeling parameters.

The more general vision for Syberia is still in progress, but aims
to unify the currently disparate realms of R packages, script codebases,
Shiny dashboards, R web apps, and reproducible analysis. In the
viewpoint of the author, R is syntactic sugar around LISP, which
enables arbitrary computation; Syberia is an attempt to support this
conjecture by allowing the construction of arbitrary software 
projects within the R programming language, thereby finally outgrowing
its long-overdue misconception as a statistical tool.

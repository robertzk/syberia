Syberia [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/syberia/syberia.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/syberia/syberia.svg?branch=master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/syberia/syberia/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/syberia/syberia) [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/rocco--docs-%E2%9C%93-blue.svg)](http://syberia.github.io/syberia/) 
===========

Syberia is the development framework for R.

The original formulation, developed at [Avant](https://github.com/avantcredit), is
[the modeling grammar](http://github.com/syberia/modeling.sy)
that serves as a machine learning classifier development and deployment
framework for solving arbitrary academic, research and business problems
that require use of statistical methods.

The modeling engine provides an opinionated unified framework for
fast iteration on classifier development and deployment. It has 
modularity and testability built in as a design assumption, is
founded on convention-over-configuration, and aims to solve the
problems of classifier-specific data preparation and
classifier-specific modeling parameters.

The more general vision for Syberia is still in progress, but aims
to unify the currently disparate realms of R packages, script codebases,
Shiny dashboards, R web apps, and reproducible analysis. In the
viewpoint of [the author](https://github.com/robertzk),
R is syntactic sugar around LISP, which enables arbitrary computation;
Syberia is an attempt to support this conjecture by allowing the
construction of arbitrary software projects within the R programming language,
thereby finally outgrowing its long-overdue misconception as a statistical tool.

The [modeling engine](https://github.com/syberia/modeling.sy),
currently the main significant engine built in Syberia,
is a framework for building, debugging, testing, and deploying
classifiers developed in R. It includes support for importing data,
preparing data, arbitrary statistical modeling methodologies,
exporting trained classifiers, validating the results, and
deploying as a REST service. 

The timeline for future engines and information about how
to contribute is listed at the [Syberia roadmap](http://syberia.io/roadmap).

## Installation

To get started right away, try out the minimal
[example syberia project](https://github.com/syberia/example.sy):

```
# Run this from your command line terminal.
git clone git@github.com:syberia/example.sy.git && cd example.sy && R
```

This will open an R console (installing dependencies for the first time may take a while;
for troubleshooting see the [troubleshooting guide](http://syberia.io/trouble)).
You can then type:

```r
run("example1")
model$predict(iris[1:5, ]) # The first five scores from a trained classifier.
# [1] 5.005686 4.757667 4.773923 4.890092 5.055138
```

For more detailed instructions, see the [installation guide](http://syberia.io/install).

### Development

To run the tests for the Syberia package, you will have to check
out its git submodules.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This will pull in `inst/engines/base.sy` from the [base engine](http://github.com/syberia/base.sy).

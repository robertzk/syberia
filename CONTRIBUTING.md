### Submitting an Issue
Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.  Ideally, an issue will contain:

* A reproducible example
* Your Syberia package version

### Submitting a Pull Request

Ideally, a PR will contain:

* Compliance with [our style guide](http://www.example.com).
* [Good code](http://engineering.intenthq.com/2015/03/what-is-good-code-a-scientific-definition/) that is [highly readable](https://gist.github.com/peterhurford/3ad9f48071bd2665a8af).
* [Solid tests](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/what-every-unit-test-needs-f6cd34d9836d) (see [how to write tests in R](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html)).

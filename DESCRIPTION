Title: Syberia
Version: 0.6.1.9003
Description: Syberia is a meta-framework for R that allows for on-the-fly
    creation of concrete frameworks for constructing arbitrary software.
    In its current formulation, the modeling engine provides an opiniated
    framework for developing production-ready machine learning classifiers in R.
    The more general vision for Syberia is still in progress, but aims
    to unify the currently disparate realms of R packages, script codebases,
    Shiny dashboards, R web apps, and reproducible analysis. In the
    viewpoint of the author, R is syntactic sugar around LISP, which
    enables arbitrary computation; Syberia is an attempt to support this
    conjecture by allowing the construction of arbitrary software 
    projects within the R programming language, thereby finally outgrowing
    its long-overdue misconception as a statistical tool.

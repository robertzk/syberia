## Syberia is a framework that was crafted specifically for the R
## programming language. The story is similar to JavaScript: a single-purpose
## language meant to be used in a particular context exploded in popularity
## and found itself in a host of other settings.
##
## However, R is really just [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lisp_programming_language_family)
## under the hood--a general purpose symbolic computing runtime. To prove that
## this makes R a viable production language for almost any purpose whatsoever,
## Syberia takes the first step of providing a hierarchical structure for R
## projects. Anything--from an empty directory, to an R package, to a collection
## of shiny dashboards--can be a Syberia project.
##
## This flexibility is achieved by assuming nothing about the underlying
## directory structure: in other words, fixing no conventions, but letting
## the user decide what the right course of action should be with respect
## to structuring their project. Other tools fare poorly at this; for example,
## a package does not even let you have a hierarchical directory structure
## in its `R/` subdirectory; what an affront to developer sanity!
##
## How can Syberia claim to be a convention-over-configuration framework
## if it fixes no conventions? The answer is that while Syberia *itself*,
## the package you are currently examining, does not fix any conventions,
## the de facto approach to development within Syberia is as follows:
##
## 1. [Pick an engine to build your work off of](http://github.com/syberia/modeling.sy).
## 2. [Build your project](https://github.com/syberia/examples) within the conventions
##    set by your choice of engine.
##
## It is possible to include multiple engines, or a whole complex potentially
## cyclic graph of engines, but this introduces [the diamond problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance)
## and should generally be avoided until you have a good understanding of
## computer science foundations.
##
## In other words, the Syberia approach is to be a *meta-framework*. By making
## no assumptions about the structure of your project, it is your choice which
## engine to build your project on depending on what suits your needs. This is
## especially helpful for machine learning projects, where the task and solution
## can take widely varying shapes depending on whether the problem is supervised,
## unsupervised, NLP, deep learning, etc.
## 
## The above 2-step approach is recursive. For example, the [modeling engine](https://github.com/syberia/modeling.sy),
## the default engine for most projects, is built off the [base engine](https://github.com/syberia/base.sy),
## which dictates that each project should have a `config/routes.R` file which
## links the `lib/controllers` directory to the rest of the project and tells 
## you how R scripts in the project are to be parsed according to which
## directory they reside in. This is similar to object-oriented programming,
## except that it is strictly more general since it does not force you 
## to treat every single thing in the world as an object.
##
## Thus, the core structural unit is an **engine**. In order to bootstrap
## effectively, an engine should have a `config/application.R` file, potentially
## empty, so that Syberia can detect this is an engine, as well as a `config/engines.R`
## file indicating which engine this one depends on, if any. This is the sole
## convention and can be pretty easily deprecated in future versions of Syberia
## if there is demand for more flexible configuration.
##
## Each engine is **testable** by design. Syberia exports a function called
## `test_project` that by default looks in the `test/` directory of the
## engine and requires all resources have an accompanying test. If your
## resource (e.g., R script) does not have a test -- it fails! In general,
## only well-written code is easily testable so this encourages both
## separating your project out into similar components through like
## directory structures as well as ensuring all inputs and outputs are
## what you expect them to be. (Not to mention saving you a huge headache
## of managing the complexity of a growing system!)
##
## To construct a Syberia engine object, run `syberia_project("/path/to/engine")`.
## This is a `syberia_engine` [R6 class](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R6/vignettes/Introduction.html)
## and holds together everything that Syberia knows about your project.
## It has methods like `$find`, `$resource`, and `$exists` to play with
## the files in your project. In general, Syberia takes a page out of
## [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)'s book and encourages all files
## to be structured so they have a single *export*: the last expression
## in the file. If you haven't replaced the default controller
## using the `config/routes` file, a topic we'll touch on later, you
## should be able to "compile" your resource using
##
## ```r
## value <- project$resource("relative/path/to/resource.R")
## ```
##
## For example, if we had
##
## ```r
## # relative/path/to/resource.R
## x <- 1
## y <- 2
## x + y
## ```
##
## then `value` above would be `3`. However, as we will see,
## the `project$resource` caller is capable of much more than
## [sourcing a file](http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/base/source).
#' Bootstrap a Syberia engine.

#' A Syberia engine defines the core re-usable structural unit across

#'
#' A Syberia engine is managed by a \code{\link[director]{director}} object.
#' This object ensures that the engine cannot access resources outside of
#' its domain, and allows insularity from other engines and the top-level
#' project from which the engine will be used.

#'    By default, the current directory.

## To build an engine, we bootstrap an otherwise bare

##
## * Registering preprocessors for `config/boot` and `config/engines`.

## * Executing `config/engines` followed by `config/boot`.
## * Ensure that the ensure has no conflicting resources with any other engine.
## * Set the cache entry `bootstrapped` on the engine to indicate it is built.
##
## The notion of preprocessor and parser belongs to
## [director](https://github.com/syberia/director). In fact, every `syberia_engine`
## inherits from `director`, so every `syberia_engine` has at least the same
## capabilities as a `director` object. (Rails experts may notice the similarity
## between Syberia engines and directors, and Rails engines and railties.)
##
## Registering a preprocessor means we do *additional stuff* before sourcing
## that file. For example, in `config/engines`, we provide a helper function
## called `engine` for registering subengines. Registering a parser means we
## do additional stuff *after* preprocessing and sourcing that file. For example,
## in `config/engines` we need to actually build and mount the engines referred
## to in the fil with the `engine` helper function.
## 
## In order to avoid the [diamond problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance),
## Syberia ensures that engines do not share resources *unless* they come from
## a common base engine. This is a technical issue that will eventually be
## explained in a more thorough whitepaper. (For the confused CS students asking
## why I couldn't have simply made engines form a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)
## instead of a possibly cyclic ## graph--the short answer is that engines need to
## trivially modularizable while ## retaining the power to refer to parent engine
## resources dynamically and just-in-time. I may very well regret this decision.)
##
## Each `director`, and by proxy `syberia_engine`, has an internal cache for
## memoising run-time state while the R process is running (this is different
## from a `director`'s *registry*, which captures persistent cross-session
## state on disk). We simply set the `bootstrapped` key to `TRUE` so we can
## check for it later.

## the `director` object, and nothing more.
boot_preprocessor <- function(source, source_env, director) {
  source_env$director <- director
  source()

## The `config/engines` file is an epsilon harder. Basically, we use
## the `engine` helper function to record the user's requested engine
## mounting until we get to the parser below.

  ## For each engine mentioned using the `engine` helper in `config/engines`,
  ## we *register* the engine. This means that we establish member variables
  ## on the respective `syberia_engine` objects that allow them to understand
  ## the topology: the parent engine knows about its children, and each child
  ## knows about its parent. Syberia is all about family.
  for (engine in ls(preprocessor_output$engines, all = TRUE)) {

  ## `exists`; we use explicit base namespacing to prevent conflicts during development.
  if (base::exists(".onAttach", envir = input, inherits = FALSE)) {
    ## A little additional trick is that the user could have specified
    ## an `.onAttach` function in the `config/engines` file. If this exists,

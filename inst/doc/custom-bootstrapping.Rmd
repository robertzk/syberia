# Custom actions on syberia project startup

When a syberia project is first loaded, it is "bootstrapped" by performing
several startup procedures: registering the config/application file,
registering the controllers, registering the routes, and setting up
the tests so that `test_project` works correctly. The user
can specify additional actions to perform using `custom_bootstrap`
if and only if a config/boot resource is present (i.e., either
config/boot.R file or config/boot/boot.R file).

Note that due to the dynamic and interactive nature of R, bootstrapping
can occur non-deterministically. Unlike, for example, a Ruby on Rails application,
which has one entrance point, a syberia project will be bootstrapped
whenever it is referenced from R code the first time. This includes when
any resources are loaded, tests are ran, configuration is accessed, etc.
You should think of the bootstrapping process as "lazy loading" all that
a syberia project needs to get to work.

Example
------

Place the following `config/boot.R` in your syberia project.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat("Bootstrapped!")
```

Whenever you perform any action that uses your syberia project for the first
time in a fresh console, you should see "Bootstrapped!"
